# Week 3 - Decision Trees, Boosting, PCA, Feature Selection
 - One and only playlist you will need to build upon tree/boosting based models - [Statquest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L39rN6gz7Y&list=PLakf6XoaFMqKLBIkOTGxUgABAeNPmbv9g)
 -  [visualization](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) of trees
 -  [Piyush rai slides](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/courses/ml_autumn16/771A_lec3_slides.pdf) on decision trees, goes into maths.
 -  What is [boosting](https://medium.com/@brijesh_soni/understanding-boosting-in-machine-learning-a-comprehensive-guide-bdeaa1167a6)?
 -  [Boosting vs Bagging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bagging-vs-boosting-in-machine-learning/)
 -  [Catboost](https://youtu.be/KXOTSkPL2X4?si=kwL7Ij4k0U46Uejd), watch its part 2 also
 -  for surface level idea of the above - [medium article]https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/tree-based-machine-learning-algorithms-explained-b50937d3cf8e
 -  [PCA](https://youtu.be/FgakZw6K1QQ?si=in5c9XHRWwGwLh5p) by statquest(GOAT!!), [Piyush rai](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/courses/ml_autumn16/771A_lec11_slides.pdf) on PCA
 -  [Shapley scores](https://youtu.be/NBg7YirBTN8?si=ZclVf-fmX16wq9pY), a good [read](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html)
 -  [RFE](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rfe-feature-selection-in-python/)
 

## Extras -
 -  A very good [book](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf) on core ml topics, can start reading this to build a very strong foundation in ml (should've shared this earlier).
 - Another good books - [ISLR](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ff2adbe3fe4fe33db902812/t/6009dd9fa7bc363aa822d2c7/1611259312432/ISLR+Seventh+Printing.pdf) and the [ESLR](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/). You can go through the above topic content from ISLR. This part is not expected to be covered in a week, you can start studying it and gradually understand the algos from a mathematical pov, but again you dont need this much for implementation ;)

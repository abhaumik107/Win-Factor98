## Week 3 Assignment 
This week you will continue working with boosting models and further feature engineering (deadline: 22nd June 2025).

A target MAE % to achieve is 25% at least, discuss with other groups if you are struggling.

You will also need to implement an MAE calculation function to calculate your loss function.
Definition of the loss: sum of the absolute differences of the ACTUAL top 11 performing players and the PREDICTED top 11 performing players.

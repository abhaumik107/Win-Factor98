 Hi guys, we are mostly done with our models/algorithms exploration, and we will start MLOps following this week. You all are expected to try to reduce you MAPE along with covering the resources.
 Also, this MLOps thing will be very new to some of you, so give it some time and you will get it. 
-  [This](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ensemble-learning) covers pretty much everything about ensembling.
-  can see some of the code on [medium](https://medium.com/@sumbatilinda/ensemble-learning-in-machine-learning-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-a00c6bae971f).
- A good [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pavansanagapati/ensemble-learning-techniques-tutorial) for code implementation
- [stacked ensembling](https://medium.com/@brijesh_soni/stacking-to-improve-model-performance-a-comprehensive-guide-on-ensemble-learning-in-python-9ed53c93ce28) - This is the main thing that you should try out this week.

#### MLOps - 

- For those wondering what even is [MLOps](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mlops)?
- [Feature Stores](https://medium.com/advancing-analytics/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-feature-stores-df98decaa19a)
- we will be using an open source feature store named FEAST, check out its [documentation](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/quickstart)
-  this medium [article](https://kedion.medium.com/creating-a-feature-store-with-feast-part-1-37c380223e2f) covers the basics of FEAST. You can also check out its [part-2](https://kedion.medium.com/feature-storage-for-ml-with-feast-part-2-34df1971a8d3).
-  I couldn't find any good video on feast but anyways you can wacth [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ8R_EUf_pM&t=11s) one. Do share if you find a good tutorial on feast.

#### week-5 Assignment -
Set up an inference pipeline for your trained model.
Make a function that takes 22 plyer ids as input (you can fetch those with a match id), and a date, and returns the top-11 players along with their predicted, actual scores and names.\n
Tip - check out for forward bias when using features for prediction, and your model should be trained before the date given.

## üìù This Week‚Äôs Task

### Main Assignment

**Build a Gradio interface for our XGBoost team selection model:**

- **Input:** Accept 22 player IDs (comma-separated) via a text box.
- **Processing:** Use the machine learning model to select the best 11-player team.
- **Output:** Display the selected team in a clear, readable format.
- **Interface:** Add a descriptive title, helpful labels, and example input.
- **Deadline**: 8th July, Tuesday

### Bonus Challenge

- **Player Name Integration:**  
 Allow users to input just the player names on the frontend and implement a logic to map these names to corresponding player IDs for seamless model integration.

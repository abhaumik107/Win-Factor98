# Week 8 Resources & Task: Reinforcement Learning for Fantasy Team Selection (Dream11)

Welcome to **Week 7**, where we dive into **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** applied to tabular data‚Äîinspired by the paper [_Optimizing Fantasy Sports Team Selection with Deep Reinforcement Learning_](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19215v1).

## Resources

### [Noisy Net](https://github.com/Kaixhin/NoisyNet-A3C)
Replace Œµ-greedy with noise-injected linear layers for exploration in DQN. This can help improve exploration strategies in your DQN agent.

### [Serving models with FastAPI](https://medium.com/@kevinnjagi83/deploying-machine-learning-models-using-fastapi-0389c576d8f1)
Learn how to deploy your trained DQN model using FastAPI, making it accessible for real-time predictions.

## üìù This Week‚Äôs Task

### Main Assignment

**Finish the DQN implementation and refactoring**

- **Refactor:** This week's PRs will be reviewed and merged, so ensure your code is clean and well-documented. Write your own documentation, make it look formal for the codebase you have developed for the project.

- **Endpoint for access:**  This project was about MLOps - making your model accessible via an API. Create an endpoint using FastAPI that allows users to input player data and receive the selected team as output.
